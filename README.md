# Dataset 

The dataset comes built-in with scikit-learn, and itâ€™s officially called the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.


# Binary classification.

We want to predict whether a tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on some measurements from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.


## Target Variable
target: 0 means malignant, 1 means benign


# Features (input variables)

There are 30 numerical features, like:

mean radius: average size of the tumor

mean texture: variation in texture

mean perimeter, mean area

mean smoothness: smoothness of cell edges

Each is a measurement calculated over the shape or texture of the tumor in an image.
